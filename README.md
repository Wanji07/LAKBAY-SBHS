# LAKBAY SBHS  
**Campus Navigation System for San Bartolome High School**

LAKBAY SBHS is a web-based campus navigation system designed to help students, visitors, and staff easily locate classrooms, offices, and facilities within San Bartolome High School. This project serves as a **pre-implementation capstone project** developed for academic and research purposes.

## 📌 Project Overview

Navigating large school campuses can be challenging, especially for new students and visitors. LAKBAY SBHS aims to address common navigation issues by providing a clear, visual, and user-centered wayfinding solution.

This system is aligned with the research titled:

> **“A Descriptive Study on Navigation Challenges of Senior High School Students as Basis for a Web-Based Wayfinding System for San Bartolome High School.”**
